Welcome to 2016 and welcome to panoplei!

panoplei is a collection of artwork from me, J. Travis Duncan. My work is mainly produced  with acrylics and tends to consist of things seen and/or experienced in the natural world. Colored with vibrant hues reminiscent of the Fauvists, my style leans towards fast and loose, but also in the realm of the Impressionists and Post Impressionists. Always looking for the next muse, my artwork continues to evolve. My mantra is simple: Create constantly and consistently, but never too carefully.
