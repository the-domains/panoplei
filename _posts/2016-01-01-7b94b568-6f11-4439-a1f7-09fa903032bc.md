# Dress Rehearsal

For my first painting of 2016, I wanted to do something raw and unplanned. Grabbing an 11x14 back-stapled canvas and my paints, I started applying yellows, blues, black and white. Upon first look, I had made a mess, but then again, what is creativity without chaos?

Staring at the painting, I applied more green and black. It began to look like a body of water in a shadowy place hidden from a distant sunrise. Pushing more paint with the palette knife a wetland began to take shape. Next I knew, a few old trees were added in the foreground and background. I had painted the silhouette of an egret on a Southern summer sunset back in mid 2015\. This time, I could envision the nice white feathers contrasting against the darker colors. So, the egret was the one part of the painting that created with a brush. I kept the strokes heavy, but loose, to maintain the semi-raw look of the rest of the piece.

Naming the painting was the final stage. What do I name it? What did it look like to me? I didn't want to say anything about that pinkish sunrise. I didn't want to draw attention to the swamp. The subject was the egret. Being in solitude, tucked away in the cove, it was just the creature, God, and nothing more. It was it's own dress rehearsal before going out into the open world for nature or a passing photographer to see. "Dress Rehearsal" was to become the name.
